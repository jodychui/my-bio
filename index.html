  <h3>
 During the summer, I compete in golf tournaments. Other than competing in tournaments, I also play badminton because I get a good cardio workout. Other times I hang out with my friends and we watch a movie, bake, or go to beaches. I also like traveling around the world. Overall, I enjoy sleeping because I don't get much during the school year.
